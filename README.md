## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions (Source-Based)

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Install Qt6 development packages:

#### Debian / Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-webengine-dev qt6-websockets-dev  qt6-tools-dev qt6-base-dev-tools

```

#### Arch Linux

```
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-webengine qt6-websockets

```

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtwebengine-devel qt6-qtwebsockets-devel

```

### üß± Build Steps (CMake)

```
git clone https://github.com/khumnath/aksharshala.git
cd aksharshala
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

```

This will produce the `aksharshala` binary in the `build/` directory.

## üì¶ Runtime Dependencies

If you're running a prebuilt binary, these are the **runtime packages** required:

### Debian / Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install qt6-base-plugins qt6-webengine-plugins qt6-websockets-plugins libqt6core6 libqt6gui6 libqt6widgets6 libqt6webengine6 libqt6websockets6 libqt6network6

```

### Arch Linux

```
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-webengine qt6-websockets

```

Arch bundles runtime and dev files together, so no separate runtime packages.

### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase qt6-qtwebengine qt6-qtwebsockets

```
